                            <p> I knew I had an amazing Oppurtunity, so I focused myself into 4 Learning Goals, and put my energy into developing them the best that I could.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p><strong>Improve Presentation Skills: </strong> Working in an agile enviornment, I was required to demo my completed stories at the end of each week. This was an issue considering I would normally get nervous speaking infront of others. I took this oppurtunity to practice as much as I could, and by the end of the term I no longer felt nervous</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p><strong>	Improve Leadership Skills: </strong> At the end of my first 4 month term, all of my fellow co-ops left, and a new co-hort arrived. This put me in a position where I held seniority, and was required to lead the other Co-ops. I felt I should take this seriously, and work on developing leadership skills as best I could.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p><strong>	Learn Node.js: </strong> Coming into this position, I had never worked with Node.js, or any JavaScript for that matter. I was hoping that by the end of the term, I would feel competent with these technologies. I feel that I succeeded in this regard.</p>

                            <p>When applying for this position, the job was described as follows:</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>"The Innovation Web Application Developer Coop will be an entry level member of a team that provides development and maintenance efforts on a variety of web and mobile based application projects in our Innovation Program.

                            <p></p>
                            <p>This may seem vague, but that was due to the fact that the innovation program is encouraged to come up with ideas of their own, and prototype them. The job became whatever we could make of it. </p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>This level of freedom turned out to be daunting, but a huge asset. Once we felt comfortable we were producing new product prototypes on a bi-weekly basis.</p>

                            <p>Altogether, this has been the greatest work term I have completed thus far, for a number of reasons. Firstly, it would be hard to match the personal development I made here, with regards to technical skills and interpersonal skills. Secondly, working in the heart of downtown toronto, in a flashy new office, the enviornment was also hard to beat. The job was hard, but I loved every minute of it.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p><strong>Special Acknowledgements: </strong> I would like to thank my first cohort of Co-ops Adnan, Zak and Kunlin for always working to maintain a positive and healthy work enviornment, and struggling to learn along side me. I would also like to thank the second group (of mostly Guelph students): Trevor, Matt and Maddie, you guys were amazing.  My gratitude also goes out to my partners working full-time and management: Brian, Iris, Samantha, Kevin and Amy. And last but not least, my incredibly patient and amazingly kind boss, Heidi.</p>
