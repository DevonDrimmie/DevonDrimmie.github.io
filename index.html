                            <h2>Goals</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <p>As a Software Engineering student entering a customer service job, I was initally disapointed. I felt that I would not be able to develop skills that would be useful in my career during my workterm, simply because I wasnt going to be programming. I quickly realized that this wasnt the case, and learned to real value of communication and problem solving skills. I made it my goal to maximize my personal growth during these 8 months, concentrated into 4 skills.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p><strong>Oral/Written Communication: </strong> Throughout my day, I awnser upwards of 80 phone calls and respond to hundreds of emails in our ticketing system. The sheer volume of communication I undergo in one day allows me to practice and perfect my written and oral communication skills. These are invaluable assets in any workplace, as the ability to communicate is important when interfacing with team members, supervisors and customers in every job. I gauged my progress through the automatic feedback and satisfaction surveys clients would recieve after we spoke, as the term went on the amount of positive feedback I recieved increased at a steady rate.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p><strong>Networking: </strong> Our Help Centre was a small subdivison of the Client Productivity department. In my day to day activity I only ever interfaced with my 4 co-workers and my supervisor, and occasionally with some of the employees in services support in our neighbouring office. I felt that developing a broad network, and the ability to make contacts would be a huge asset in my professional life. As a result of this, I went out of my way to get on a first name basis with managers in other departments, who I would not normally speak with. I also joined the IT Student Advisory Council as a representative of CCS, which allows me to meet and work with several high ranking members of the University once a month.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p><strong>Leadership: </strong> When I first arrived at CCS, the amount of new technologies and company policies I had to familiarize myself with was overwhelming. However my supervisor had offered to past Co-op students jobs during our training period in the summer so that they could assist in training. The work these students did was immeasurably helpful, and it truly showed me the importance and effectiveness of a strong leader. As a result of this, I set the goal for myself that as my coop term was ending, I would help assist the next Generation of CCS Co-ops to make their transition easier. This recently became my reality as the Co-ops only had one week available for training before they started full time. Luckily everything went smoothly and I feel my leadership skills have improved a lot over my 8 month term.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p><strong>Problem Solving: </strong> When you work as an IT Support Specialist at CCS, there are no guidelines on what you will do each and every day. You simply come to work in the morning and spend 8 hours dealing with whatever problems someone brings you. This can feel stressful, but it also provides the ability to think critically about problems and develop the tools nesscary to solve them. I set a goal for myself to not only get better at solving problems, but to learn what it means to be good at problem solving. I found that the more I knew, whether it be about the University, our Services, our platforms or teams, the more problems I could solve. The tools and knowledge I gained while working at CCS will not only help in future job endeavors, but also in life.</p>

                            <p>When applying for this position, the job was described as follows:</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>"As a Student Consultant you will work closely with CCS IT staff to provide technical troubleshooting, IT information and IT solutions to our clients within the University. In the Help Center and at the IT Help Desk you will answer questions about CCS Services and applications, supported products and a wide variety of computing issues including network connectivity, email software/Gryph mail and virus/malware problems. As a Student Consultant you will be exposed to technology and IT service areas including Network Infrastructure, Security, Directory Services and a number of campus-wide applications. This position provides staff with the opportunity to develop critical customer service skills, analytical and troubleshooting skills. Student Consultants will also assist with the creation of customer and web documentation and there may be opportunities to work on special projects with other CCS teams."</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>However it's hard to describe a position where your duties are simply to help with any problems that the university community could encounter. Because of this, I usually describe my job as "giving my best effort". We did not have a list of products or services that we supported, we simply always had to give our best effort to help our clients. If a client called in and wanted help with a software I had never used, I wouldnt dismiss it, I would research it and give it my best effort. If a student was buying a new printer and wanted advice, even if I knew nothing about printers I would always give their problems my best effort.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Altogether, I was given problems through phone calls, emails and in person, and my job was to always do my best to solve them.</p>

                            <p>Altogether, I entered this work term with low expectations, but I feel this may end up being the most valuable Co-op work term that I will experience. Although my 8 month term has ended, I am continuing my employment with CCS during the school year. CCS provides students with a relaxed enviornment and plenty of mentors and role models for you to develop your interpersonal communications skills. Over an 8 month period I was able to cement my Teamwork, Communication and Problem solving skills, which will be invaluable going forwards in life. Not once in that 8 month period was I upset to wake up and go to work, and it seems like two work terms passed in the time of a week. It really does feel like a second family, and I am forever thankful I was given the oppurtunity to work with them. </p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p><strong>Special Acknowledgements: </strong> I would like to thank my fellow Co-ops Joao, Alysa and Kendra for always working to maintain a positive and healthy work enviornment. My gratitude also goes out to Garrett, Heather and Carolyn from Services Support, who always were happy to lend a helping hand, and last but not least I would like to thank my best boss yet, and possibly the best boss I'll ever have, Jill.</p>
